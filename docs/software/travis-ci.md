Travis-CI is the most popular continuous integration/continuous development service. It easily integrates with GitHub, though there doesn't really seem to be a local server image. The syntax is YAML and easier to write than Jenkins' pipeline syntax, plus we don't need to worry about having a local Jenkins server and build slave configured for Docker builds.
