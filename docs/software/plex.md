### Installation 
  - Download the `.deb` from Plex
  - `sudo dpkg -i plexmedia...`
  - Go to `http://containerip:32400/web`
  - Add NFS media directories as necessary
  - Configuring server name and media directories directly after installation may result in 'There was a problem saving these settings' warnings, but after a few minutes will disappear.
