### About 

This page is for miscellaneous notes on deep learning concepts, ideas, and problems. In time these will be expanded into their own pages, but for now these serve as bookmarks.

### Types 
  * Neural Network
  * Convolutional Neural Network
  * Recurrent Neural Network (GUR, LSTM)
  * GAN

### Problems 
  * Image classification
  * Representation Learning
  * AutoEncoder
  * Image to text/caption generation
  * Starry night + photo = Starry night photo
  * Image detection or outline of objects
  * Bounding box of faces
  * Heatmap of images for classifier predictions
  * GAN image/text generation
  * TensorBoard
  * Audio transcription, detection, etc

### Concepts 
  * Number of filters, stride lengths, padding
  * Data augmentation, ie, rotating images, flipping, shifting, etc
  * Global vs local pooling and min/max/average pooling
  * No pooling in between convolutional layers but at end
  * batch normalization
  * dilation
  * Dropout versus explicit regularization
  * Alternating convolutional layers beginning with descending 128 hidden layers to 64, 32, 16 before pooling with two sets of convolutional layers with stride length two first and one second
  * conditional random fields

  * kaggle datasets
  * cv datasets on the web for image datasets in computer vision
  * not hotdog
  * netflix movies
  * originalsnapchat filter
  * twitter stream
  * signal processing
  * google cloud big data platform 
  * vci machine learning repository 
  * github awesome public datasets
  * autoencoders
  * places 365 dataset
  * scikit-image bounding box segmentation
  * segnet
  * tsosu technique
  * visualize outputs in CNN model network layers (ir.com blog post)
  * MNIST GAN example from https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-generative-adversarial-networks-c076d8db8f44
  * google cloud ml examples, they tag stack overflow posts
