### Welcome! 

### What's this and what's it for? 

This is my personal wiki. It will contain relevant information on software installations & configurations, statistical and machine learning techniques and descriptions, and other related topics. 

### What's it going to look like? 

This wiki will attempt to be organized by broad topic like installation guide, statistics, etc. Longer pages will have a table of contents. Relevant links to external sources will also be provided in the pages. Code snippets and images will also be included.
