- jrnl for personal journal with backup to version control along with pictures everyday of self.
- mkdocs for wiki instead of dokuwiki. Editing may be more annoying innitialy, but deploying to a static site is easier and current conversion script doesn't work properly. add links to wiki for my bookmarks
- snippets repository to source control instead of in wiki
- bookmark link/read it later list, kanban task board
- deep learning - as much as possible
- general statistics - which tests to use for what problem, more general here's a dataset and do something with it, just basic here's data with no goal find something interesting, etc
- web development with flask, using authentication, templates, forms, data tables, etc. Deployment with horizontal scaling, load balancing, redis caching, api
- kerberos authentication
- docker: compose, dockerfiles, swarm, before moving to other services like traefik, kubernetes
- ci/cd deployments using drone + local docker host/travis-ci + heroku since jenkins fucking sucks
- redhat vm for practicing unix certifications, knowledge of bashrc, exporting variables, general configuration files, not dumping everything that needs to run on boot into rc.local
- more shiny apps
- reverse proxy for web applications not on host
- grafana with relational + nosql + graph databases
- redo existing unix containers with better organization - like lxc on 100ids, vm on 200ids, get rid of ones not going to always use. Start with plex, calibre, torrent, git, essential services, etc. Remove practice container since being replaced with redhat vm.
