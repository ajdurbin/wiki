This wiki is for natural language processing methods and ideas.

# Packages #
- gensim
- nltk
- spacy
- textblob

# General #
- text summarization (different algorithms than bag of words)
- bag of words
- tf-idf
- word2vec
- doc2vec
- ngram
- topic modeling
- topic segmentation
- lda/lsi
- text tiling
- wordclouds
- keyword/keyphrase extraction
- Gensim for modeling and named entity stuff. First stream tokenized text and then construct phrases and then from there train a word2vec/doc2vec model
- gensim phrases model
- svm text classification on tfidf vectors
- sklearn has a couple good text articles
- really good tutorial on text svm classification at <https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-nlp-text-classification-using-scikit-learn-python-and-nltk-c52b92a7c73a>
- can also do lds/lsi/neuralnetwork/naive bayes on these results from tfidf, clustering too for unsupervised problems (example on sklearn)
- gensim has common phrases utility to be included in phrases function, so if we are bigramming and want to to identify words in a common sequence like 'of' in 'secretary of state' without trigramming.
- Grid search best topic models from <https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-python-sklearn-examples/>
- Possible method to be used in searching a large corpus of documents for keywords and returning the documents where the probability of certain topics is highest: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15377290/unsupervised-automatic-tagging-algorithms>
- Looking at most important words in SVM text classification <https://medium.com/@aneesha/visualising-top-features-in-linear-svm-with-scikit-learn-and-matplotlib-3454ab18a14d>
- document/word clustering
- sklearn text data examples
- lda with specific solvers is lsa/lsi
- similarly truncted svd with term matrices is lsa/lsi
- machine learning plus has a couple really good tutorials on lda
- gensim has some tutorials too
- nlp for hackers text cluster example recipe
- normalize/smooth tfidf before nmf/pca
- sklearn text examples/snippets
- gensim examples/snippets
- tfidftransformer vs tfidfvectorizer and their application on countvectorizer
- document clustering/classification
- gensim + keras text classification using lstm
- gensim has many github tutorials
- fasktext
- legal dataset from lawinsider for document clustering/classification
- word counts/wordclouds/similarities/ngramming(phrases)/sentiment/clustering/classification/lda/lsa(lsi)
- stemming/tfidf
- averaging word vectors
- deep inverse regression with yelp reviews
- use pretrained word vectors like Google's, GloVe, stanford, etc.
