  * scikit-learn
    * Machine learning toolkit. Consistent syntax for various classification and regression techniques.
  * StatsModels
    * Compared to scikit-learn, more statistically oriented with output of p-values, etc. Output similar to `R`  statistical tests. Contains many statistical tests not found in scipy.stats or scikit-learn.
  * TensorFlow
    * Deep learning library, uses GPU for acceleration.
  * Keras
    * Wrapper for TensorFlow with common utilities.
  * XGBoost
    * Popular library for implementing boosted trees. Faster than scikit-learn implementation. Can offload on GPU.
  * PyODBC
    * Database connection utility.
  * smtplib
    * Used for sending emails given a SMTP server.
  * Multiprocessing
    * Relatively straightforward to use parallel processing module. Most used components are `Pool, map, starmap`.
  * scikit-image
    * Image processing module with various utilities for transforming images
  * Numba
    * Just-in-time compiler for array-oriented, math-heavy python code. Can offload calculations to GPU.
  * PySpark
    * Spark connector for python. Offers modelling modules as well.
  * locust
    * HTTP server load testing tool, useful for testing APIs.
  * flask/flask_redis/flask_api
    * Microservice for writing web applications and web APIs. Redis module is for server-side caching.
  * tqdm
    * Useful progress bar for looping operations
  * hue
    * Prettier terminal printing
  * Requests
    * HTTP post/get operations for web servers
  * retrying
    * Useful for retrying connections to web servers, database servers, etc.

    * Shell utilities, like copying files from one directory to another. Somewhat overlaps with os module
  * pytesseract
    * OCR of images
  * textract
    * Able to read 'text' PDFs, docx files, etc.
  * opencv-python
  * tox
    * test suite for programs
  * tempfile
    * create temporary files/directories
  * faker
    * create fake data like names, addresses, phone numbers text for population of databases or testing
  * jupyter widgets
    * not quite R Shiny
  * dateutil
    * Additional datetime functionality, like relative deltas
  * limeml
    * explain predictions of classifiers graphically - have not looked into more
  * pyowm
    * Python wrapper for OpenWeatherMap API
  * plotly
    * Interactive graphics. Complicated syntax and need API
  * Bokeh
    * Slightly interactive graphics
  * nose
    * similar testing to tox
  * ast
    * abstract syntax trees. Turn a string of a command into the actual command. 
  * affinity
    * sometimes os parallel processes are weird
  * itertools
    * lots of useful functions in here, repea and chain.from_iterable to unpack nested lists
  * joblib
    * more advanced distributed computing
  * scrapy
    * web scraper
